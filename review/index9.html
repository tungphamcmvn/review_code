  <h1>Git Commit Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Commit Purpose Summary</h2>
  <p class="positive">
    The commit fixes ESLint warnings and errors in SCSS files. It cleans up the code formatting and style to adhere to
    the project's ESLint rules. The changes include:
  <ul>
    <li>Adding spaces after colons in style rules</li>
    <li>Removing empty lines</li>
    <li>Correcting indentation</li>
    <li>Using lowercase for hex color codes</li>
    <li>Deleting an empty styles.module.scss file</li>
  </ul>
  Suggested commit message: "style: fix ESLint warnings in SCSS files"
  </p>

  <h2>2. Alignment with Application Architecture</h2>
  <p class="positive">
    The changes made in the commit align well with the overall application architecture. The modified SCSS files are
    located in the appropriate directories under src/components, matching the structure described. No adjustments to the
    architecture are necessary based on these style-related changes.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Adherence to Best Practices</h2>
  <p class="positive">
    The commit improves the codebase's adherence to coding best practices by:
  <ul>
    <li>Following a consistent code formatting style</li>
    <li>Removing unnecessary empty lines and files</li>
    <li>Using lowercase for hex color codes for consistency</li>
  </ul>
  The changes enhance code readability and maintainability. No further corrections are needed from a best practices
  perspective.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Performance and Security Considerations</h2>
  <p class="positive">
    The changes in this commit are purely style-related and do not have a direct impact on the performance or security
    of the Next.js, React.js, and MongoDB application. The removed empty styles.module.scss file slightly reduces the
    overall code size, but the performance gain is negligible. No additional performance or security enhancements are
    necessary based on the modifications in this commit.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Development Time Estimate</h2>
  <p>
    The changes in this commit are relatively straightforward and primarily involve updating the formatting and style of
    SCSS files. A senior developer familiar with the codebase and ESLint rules would likely be able to complete these
    modifications in approximately <span class="positive">30 minutes to 1 hour</span>.
