  </section>

    <h2>2. Architecture Alignment</h2>
    <p>The changes in 'diff.txt' align well with the described application architecture and file structure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The routes defined in 'src/routes.ts' include a
          'companyProfile' route, which matches the added permission for the company profile.</span></li>
      <li><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The authentication and authorization logic in 'src/auth.ts'
          and 'src/middleware.ts' can handle the added permission checks for the company profile.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>No major discrepancies or required adjustments were identified.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>3. Best Practices Assessment</h2>
    <p>The changes in 'diff.txt' generally adhere to Next.js and React.js best practices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The new route is defined in 'src/routes.ts' following the
          existing convention.</span></li>
      <li><span style="background-color:red;color:white;">Consider adding JSDoc comments to describe the purpose and
          parameters of the new route in 'src/routes.ts'.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
    <p>The changes in 'diff.txt' do not introduce any apparent performance or security issues within the Next.js,
      React.js, and MongoDB context.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The added permission check for the company profile route
          should have minimal impact on performance.</span></li>
      <li><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The existing authentication and authorization mechanisms in
          'src/auth.ts' and 'src/middleware.ts' should ensure proper security for the company profile route.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>5. Code Logic Evaluation</h2>
    <p>The code logic in 'diff.txt' is straightforward and follows the existing patterns in the codebase.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The new 'companyProfile' route is defined with a clear
          label, URL, and key.</span></li>
      <li><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The permission check for the company profile should be
          handled by the existing authorization middleware.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>No major issues or improvements were identified in the code logic.</p>
  </section>
