  <h1>Git Commit Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Commit Purpose Summary</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this commit appears to be to apply changes to support getting a project from the frontend. Key
    modifications include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simplifying the invoice upsert API route to just return a success response without fully implementing invoice
      upserting logic.</li>
    <li>Adding a new GET route to retrieve a specific project by ID.</li>
    <li>Removing several old project-related API routes that are no longer needed (create, list, add budget, import
      budget, update contractors).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A suggested commit message could be:</p>
  <div class="positive"> "Add get project by ID API, remove old project routes, stub out invoice upsert
    Implement GET /api/project/[id] to retrieve a project
    Remove unused /api/project/create, list, add-budget, import-project-budget, update-project-contractors routes
    Stub POST /api/invoice/upsert to just return success response for now"
  </div>
  <h2>2. Alignment with Application Architecture</h2>
  <p>The changes mostly align with the intended application architecture, but a few adjustments could be considered:</p>
  <div class="negative"> The invoice upsert route in src/app/api/invoice/upsert/route.ts has been stubbed out to just
    return a success response. While this may be temporary, it's important to add a TODO comment indicating the need to
    fully implement the invoice upsert logic to align with the intended functionality. </div>
  <div class="positive"> The new project GET route follows the pattern of defining API routes in the src/app/api
    directory structure. This aligns well with the overall architecture. </div>
  <div class="positive"> Removing the unused project-related routes helps clean up the codebase to include only the
    needed functionality. </div>
  <h2>3. Best Practices Adherence</h2>
  <div class="negative"> The stubbed invoice upsert route always returns a 500 status even though the TODO message says
    it should return a 200. Update to return the correct status code. </div>
  <div class="negative"> The error handling in the project GET route could be improved. Instead of returning the raw
    error, consider logging the full error details on the server-side for debugging while returning a more generic error
    message to the client. </div>
  <div class="positive"> The project GET route does a good job validating the input project ID and returning an
    appropriate 400 error if the ID is missing or the project is not found. </div>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security Considerations</h2>
  <div class="positive"> The project GET route looks up the project directly by ID which should be performant assuming
    proper database indexing on the project ID field. </div>
  <div class="negative"> Ensure the project GET route is protected by proper authentication and authorization checks,
    either at the route level or using Next.js middleware, to secure access to project data. The current code does not
    show these checks. </div>
  <h2>5. Development Time Estimate</h2>
  <p>For a senior developer, the changes in this commit would likely take in the range of 2-4 hours to implement, test,
    and review, assuming they are already familiar with the codebase and project setup.</p>
