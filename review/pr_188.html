  <h1>Pull Request Title</h1>
  <p>Based on the diff.txt file, this pull request aims to update the Project Invoice Listing screen for Builder/Super
    Admin roles. It is part of the ticket #J2C-472.</p>
  <h1>Architecture Alignment</h1>
  <p>The modifications in diff.txt align with the described application architecture and db schema. No major
    discrepancies were identified.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes are isolated to a specific feature and do not appear to
    impact the overall architecture.</p>
  <h1>Best Practices Assessment</h1>
  <p>The code changes generally adhere to Next.js and React.js best practices. A few observations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code follows a modular structure, with separate directories for
      components, services, and utilities.</li>
    <li>Consider using more descriptive variable and function names to enhance code readability.</li>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">Ensure consistent formatting and indentation throughout the modified
      code.</li>
    <li>Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious functionality.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Performance and Security</h1>
  <p>The modifications do not appear to introduce any significant performance or security concerns. However, consider
    the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Optimize database queries to minimize the amount of data retrieved, especially for the invoice listing screen.
    </li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Implement proper access controls and authorization checks for the
      Builder/Super Admin roles.</li>
    <li>Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Code Logic Evaluation</h1>
  <p>The code logic in the modifications appears to be sound overall. A few points to consider:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Review the logic for filtering and sorting the invoice listing to ensure accurate results.</li>
    <li>Handle edge cases and error scenarios gracefully, providing meaningful error messages to users.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Break down complex functions into smaller, reusable functions for
      better maintainability.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Estimation Time</h1>
  <p>Based on the scope of the modifications and the complexity of the invoice listing screen, a senior developer would
    likely require approximately 8-12 hours to develop this pull request.</p>
  <p>This estimation includes time for code implementation, testing, and addressing any feedback or adjustments needed.
