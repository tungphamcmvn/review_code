  <h1>Pull Request Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Pull Request Title:</h2>
  <p>Based on the diff provided, a suitable title for this pull request would be:</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">J2C-327: Address UI Issues and Improve Error Handling</p>
  <h2>2. Architecture Alignment:</h2>
  <p>The changes in the diff appear to align with the described Next.js, React, and MongoDB architecture. A few notes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The changes are limited to the frontend code and don't impact the backend services, models, or DB schema</li>
    <li>The modified files are located in the expected directories based on the architecture (e.g. next.config.js,
      src/config.ts, src/middleware.ts, src/routes.ts)</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes follow the separation of concerns and modular
      architecture</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>3. Best Practices Assessment:</h2>
  <p>The code changes mostly adhere to React and Next.js best practices. A couple suggestions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In next.config.js, the <code>reactStrictMode</code> option is set to false due to an error. While this
      workaround is sometimes needed, it's best to investigate and fix the underlying issue to be able to enable strict
      mode.</li>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">Avoid disabling ESLint during production builds in next.config.js.
      Linting helps catch potential issues and should run in all environments.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The modular import configuration and font optimization in
      next.config.js are good practices to reduce bundle size.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The config and route definitions are cleanly organized in
      src/config.ts and src/routes.ts.</li>
    <li>Consider adding more specific types in src/auth.ts instead of using `any` to improve type safety.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security:</h2>
  <p>The changes don't appear to have a significant direct performance impact. However, a few considerations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The image optimization and CDN configuration in next.config.js can
      help improve performance by serving optimized images.</li>
    <li>Evaluate if all the defined env vars in next.config.js are being used. Remove any unused ones to slightly
      improve build times.</li>
    <li>In src/auth.ts, ensure that password comparison is being done securely, preferably using a constant-time
      equality check to avoid timing attacks.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The granular UserStatus enum and max failed login attempts check in
      src/auth.ts is a good security practice.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>5. Code Logic Evaluation:</h2>
  <p>The code changes seem logical overall. The config, middleware, and routes are defined clearly. The src/auth.ts
    changes handle edge cases like invalid login attempts. A couple notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The logic to convert a string to an enum in src/auth.ts makes sense, but consider adding validation to handle
      the scenario where an invalid string is passed in.</li>
    <li>The failedLoginAttempts update logic in src/auth.ts looks correct. I would just suggest adding a few comments to
      explain the 5-attempts lockout policy to make the code more maintainable.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>6. Estimation Time:</h2>
  <p>Given the scope of the changes affecting configuration, middleware, routes, and authentication across several
    files, I would estimate this pull request to take an experienced senior developer roughly:</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">3-5 hours to develop and fully test.</p>
  <p>This factors in some additional time to QA the failed login lockout (which requires hitting failure edge cases) and
    to ensure the config changes don't adversely impact app functionality.</p>
