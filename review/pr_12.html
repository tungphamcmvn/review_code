  <h1>Pull Request Analysis</h1>
  <h2>Pull Request Title</h2>
  <p>[User] Apply api user for FE</p>
  <p>This pull request makes modifications to the user API endpoints and related code to enable user functionality for
    the frontend of the application.</p>
  <h2>Architecture Alignment</h2>
  <p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes in diff.txt align well with the overall architecture
      described in codebase.txt.</span> The modifications are focused on the user-related API endpoints, services, and
    repositories, which match the structure outlined in the architecture overview.</p>
  <p>The changes also adhere to the MongoDB schema defined in dbschema.txt for the User model.</p>
  <h2>Best Practices Assessment</h2>
  <p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code changes generally follow best practices for Next.js and
      React.js development.</span> Some positive points:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience</li>
    <li>Separating concerns with dedicated API routes, services, and repositories</li>
    <li>Utilizing DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for data mapping and validation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>One area for improvement:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="background-color:red;color:white;">Consider adding more detailed error handling and logging for
        better debugging and monitoring in production.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Performance and Security</h2>
  <p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes do not introduce any major performance or security
      concerns.</span> However, a few suggestions for further enhancement:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure proper input validation and sanitization to prevent potential injection attacks</li>
    <li>Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to protect against excessive requests</li>
    <li>Consider caching frequently accessed data to improve performance</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Code Logic Evaluation</h2>
  <p>The code logic in the user-related changes is straightforward and easy to follow. Some positive aspects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using async/await for handling asynchronous operations</li>
    <li>Leveraging MongoDB's findOneAndUpdate for atomic updates</li>
    <li>Utilizing Next.js API routes for a clear separation of frontend and backend concerns</li>
  </ul>
  <p>One suggestion for improvement:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="background-color:red;color:white;">Consider extracting common validation logic into reusable
        middleware or utility functions to keep the API route handlers focused on their core responsibilities.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Estimation Time</h2>
  <p>Based on the scope and complexity of the changes, a senior developer would likely require approximately <strong>2-3
      days</strong> to implement these user-related modifications, including testing and documentation.</p>
