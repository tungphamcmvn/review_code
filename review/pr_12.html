  <h1>Pull Request Title:</h1>
  <p>The pull request titled "Apply api user for FE" aims to modify the builder and user APIs in the backend to support
    frontend functionality. Key changes include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Updating the builder GET API to support pagination, sorting, and searching</li>
    <li>Removing the _id field from the builder PUT API response</li>
    <li>Adding a PATCH endpoint to update user status and failed login attempts</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Architecture Alignment:</h1>
  <p>The changes align well with the described application architecture and database schema:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The modifications to the builder API endpoints in
      src/app/api/builder follow the API structure.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The addition of the user status PATCH endpoint in
      src/app/api/user/[id]/status aligns with the user API structure.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The builder service updates in
      src/backend/services/builder.service.ts handle the new listing functionality.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">No discrepancies found between the diff and the provided
      architecture and schema.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Best Practices Assessment:</h1>
  <p>The changes mostly adhere to Next.js and React.js best practices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">API routes are properly structured and handle requests/responses
      correctly.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Services are used to encapsulate business logic and interact with
      repositories.</li>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">Some API handlers could be refactored to use a generic error handling
      middleware to avoid repetitive try/catch blocks.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Proper HTTP status codes are returned in API responses.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Performance and Security:</h1>
  <p>The changes have minimal impact on performance and security:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Pagination, sorting, and searching in the builder API will improve
      performance for large datasets.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Removing the _id field from API responses reduces response size and
      improves network efficiency.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The user status update endpoint checks for valid JWT and user
      permissions, ensuring secure access.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Code Logic Evaluation:</h1>
  <p>The code logic in the changes is generally sound:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The builder service's listBuilders method properly handles
      pagination, sorting, searching, and DTO conversion.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The user status update endpoint correctly updates the user's status
      and failed login attempts based on the provided action.</li>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">Error handling in the builder GET API could be improved by using a
      generic error response structure.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Estimation Time:</h1>
  <p>For a senior developer, implementing these changes would likely take around 4-6 hours, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2-3 hours for the builder API modifications (pagination, sorting, searching)</li>
    <li>1-2 hours for the user status update endpoint</li>
    <li>1 hour for testing and code review</li>
  </ul>

In summary, the pull request aligns well with the application architecture and follows best practices for the most part.
A few areas could be improved, such as error handling and response structures, but overall the changes are solid. The
estimated development time for a senior developer is around 4-6 hours.
