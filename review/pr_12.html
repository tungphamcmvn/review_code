  <h1>Pull Request Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Pull Request Title</h2>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The pull request titled "Apply api user for FE" summarizes the main
    purpose well, which is to implement API endpoints for user management in the frontend.</p>
  <h2>2. Architecture Alignment</h2>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes align with the described application architecture:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>API routes for user management are added under src/app/api/user/ which follows the pattern of defining API
      endpoints by model/functionality.</li>
    <li>User service (src/backend/services/user.service.ts) is updated to handle the new API logic, which interacts with
      the user repository as expected.</li>
    <li>The database schema for User model in dbschema.txt matches the fields being queried and updated in the API
      endpoints.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>3. Best Practices Assessment</h2>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code mostly follows Next.js and React best practices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>API routes use the Next.js convention of defining handlers for each HTTP method.</li>
    <li>Input validation is performed using validation classes in src/backend/validator/.</li>
    <li>Services encapsulate the core business logic and interact with repositories to access the database.</li>
    <li>DTOs are used to define the shape of data being transferred between layers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:red;color:white;">One issue is that some of the API handlers directly use the repositories
    to fetch/update data instead of going through the services layer. It's best to consistently use the services to
    encapsulate the logic and only use repositories directly in the services.</p>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes don't introduce any major performance issues. Indexing
    seems to be set up correctly on the queried User fields based on the schema.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">For security, the AuthService is used to verify JWT tokens before
    allowing access to the endpoints that require authentication. This follows security best practices.</p>
  <h2>5. Code Logic Evaluation</h2>
  <p>The code logic looks mostly fine, with the API endpoints handling CRUD operations on users as expected:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>GET /api/user fetches paginated users with optional sorting and filtering.</li>
    <li>POST /api/user creates a new user.</li>
    <li>GET /api/user/[id] fetches a single user by ID.</li>
    <li>PUT /api/user/[id] updates a user's details.</li>
    <li>DELETE /api/user/[id] deletes a user.</li>
    <li>PATCH /api/user/[id]/status activates or deactivates a user.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:red;color:white;">One issue is in the PATCH endpoint to update user status - it doesn't
    validate that the provided status is valid. There should be a check that status is either 'ACTIVATE' or 'DEACTIVATE'
    before updating the database.</p>
  <p>Also, minor improvement can be renaming /api/user/[id]/status to /api/user/[id]/activate or
    /api/user/[id]/deactivate to make it clearer what the endpoint does.</p>
  <h2>6. Estimated Development Time</h2>
  <p>For an experienced senior developer familiar with the codebase, implementing these changes would likely take in the
    range of <strong>1-2 days</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding the new API routes - 2-4 hours</li>
    <li>Updating user service with the new methods - 2-3 hours</li>
    <li>Adding validation and testing - 2-4 hours</li>
    <li>Code review and refinements - 1-2 hours</li>
  </ul>

The analysis highlights that overall the pull request looks good and aligns well with the application architecture and
best practices. A couple issues are flagged around inconsistent usage of services layer and lack of validation on user
status update. With minor refinements in those areas, this would be a solid pull request from an experienced developer
that could be completed in 1-2 days.
