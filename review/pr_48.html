  <h1>Pull Request Analysis: J2C-183: Update flow when self sign up</h1>
  <h2>1. Pull Request Title</h2>
  <p>The pull request aims to enhance the self-signup process by updating permissions, roles, and logic checks for user
    actions during signup, role selection, profile updates, and confirmation.</p>
  <h3>Suggested Title:</h3>
  <p>"Refine Self-Signup Flow: Permissions, Roles, and Logic Enhancements"</p>
  <h2>2. Architecture Alignment</h2>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The modifications appear to align well with the described application
    architecture. The changes involve updates to various components and services within the 'src' directory, including
    authentication views, account components, user services, and middleware. The 'lib/swagger' directory is also updated
    to reflect the API changes for documentation purposes.</p>
  <h2>3. Best Practices Assessment</h2>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code changes generally adhere to Next.js and React.js best
    practices. The use of TypeScript, ESLint, and modular imports demonstrates a focus on code quality and
    maintainability.</p>
  <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider using a state management library like Redux Toolkit or Zustand for better state management across
      components.</li>
    <li>Explore using React hooks more extensively for state management and side effects within functional components.
    </li>
    <li>Implement unit tests for components and services to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
  <h3>Performance:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The use of Next.js features like server-side rendering and static
      site generation can potentially improve performance by reducing initial load times and enhancing SEO.</li>
    <li>Consider implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve
      response times.</li>
    <li>Optimize image loading using techniques like lazy loading and responsive images to improve perceived
      performance.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Security:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The application uses JWT authentication and middleware for
      authorization checks, which are good security practices.</li>
    <li>Ensure that sensitive data like passwords are stored securely using hashing and salting techniques.</li>
    <li>Regularly update dependencies and libraries to address potential security vulnerabilities.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>5. Code Logic Evaluation</h2>
  <h3>Key Changes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Updates to permissions and roles during signup to ensure proper access control.</li>
    <li>Implementation of logic to check user status and redirect them to the appropriate steps in the signup flow based
      on their company status (pending signup, pending accept, etc.).</li>
    <li>Introduction of new API endpoints for updating user company status and joining a company.</li>
    <li>Modifications to the 'GuestGuard' and 'AuthGuard' components to handle user redirects based on their
      authentication and company status.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Potential Issues:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">The logic for assigning default roles to users during signup might
      need further clarification and testing to ensure correctness.</li>
    <li>Consider adding more robust error handling and validation for user input and API responses.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>6. Estimation Time</h2>
  <p>Based on the complexity of the changes and the need for testing and refinement, a senior developer would likely
    require approximately **2-3 days** to develop and implement this pull request effectively.</p>
