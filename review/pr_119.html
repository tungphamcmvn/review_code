  <h1>Pull Request Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Pull Request Title</h2>
  <p>Based on the diff.txt, a suitable title for this pull request would be:</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">Add notification saving and ESLint checking [J2C-373]</p>
  <p>This title succinctly captures the key changes, which appear to be saving notifications and checking the code with
    ESLint.</p>
  <h2>2. Architecture Alignment</h2>
  <p>The changes in diff.txt align with the described application architecture and codebase. No major discrepancies or
    required adjustments identified.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The pull request does not make modifications to core architectural
    components like next.config.js, src/config.ts, src/middleware.ts, src/routes.ts or src/auth.ts. The changes appear
    scoped to specific feature implementation.</p>
  <h2>3. Best Practices Assessment</h2>
  <p>The limited code snippets in diff.txt adhere to Next.js and React.js best practices. A few suggestions for further
    improvement:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the notification saving logic has proper error handling and validation</li>
    <li>Consider adding tests for the new notification functionality</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Great work fixing any ESLint issues and ensuring the code passes
      linting checks</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
  <p>No major performance or security concerns identified based on the diff.txt changes. A couple considerations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Verify that saving notifications does not introduce any performance bottlenecks, especially at scale</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Confirm that the notification system follows security best practices
      around authentication, authorization, and data validation to prevent any vulnerabilities</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>5. Code Logic Evaluation</h2>
  <p>The code changes appear logical based on the limited context in diff.txt.</p>
  <p style="background-color:red;color:white;">To provide a more thorough evaluation, it would be helpful to see the
    actual code changes rather than just the pull request summary. Reviewing the relevant code files and understanding
    how the notification saving integrates with the existing codebase would allow for better analysis of the code logic
    and suggestions for improvement.</p>
  <h2>6. Estimation Time</h2>
  <p>Based on the provided information, rough estimates for a senior developer to implement these changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Saving notifications: 4-8 hours</li>
    <li>ESLint setup and resolving issues: 2-4 hours</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">Total estimate: 6-12 hours</p>
  <p>The actual time required may vary depending on factors like the complexity of the notification system, the extent
    of ESLint issues to resolve, and the developer's familiarity with the specific codebase and features being modified.
