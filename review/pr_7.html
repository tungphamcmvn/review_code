<h1>Pull Request Analysis</h1>
<h2>1. Pull Request Title</h2>
<p>Based on the diff, an appropriate title for this pull request would be:</p>
<p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">J2C-120: Implement user deletion and archival API endpoints</span>
</p>
<p>This title succinctly captures the main purpose of the changes, which is to add API routes for deleting and archiving
  individual users.</p>
<h2>2. Architecture Alignment</h2>
<p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes align well with the described application
    architecture:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>New API routes are added under src/app/api/user/[id]/ which matches the structure for backend API endpoints.</li>
  <li>The routes utilize the existing UserRepository and UserService classes to interact with the database and apply
    business logic.</li>
  <li>Custom exception classes like NotFoundException are used for error handling.</li>
  <li>The routes return JSON responses using the ResponseStruct class to maintain a consistent API response format.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the limited database schema provided, there are no obvious misalignments. However, it would be good to
  confirm that the User model/schema supports the "LOCKED" status that the archive endpoint sets.</p>
<h2>3. Best Practices Assessment</h2>
<p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code generally follows good practices for a Next.js API
    route:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>The HTTP methods (PATCH, DELETE) semantically match the actions being performed.</li>
  <li>Parameters are validated, e.g. checking for the presence of the user ID.</li>
  <li>Authentication is checked via the Authorization header token.</li>
  <li>Errors are caught and mapped to appropriate HTTP status codes.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="background-color:red;color:white;">A few potential improvements:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Consider moving the repeated logic for decoding the auth token into a shared middleware or function.</li>
  <li>The error handling could be DRYed up by creating a shared function that takes an error and returns the appropriate
    ResponseStruct.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
<p>The routes do not appear to introduce any major performance or security concerns:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The database operations are simple finds, updates and deletes which should be relatively performant.</li>
  <li>User input (the user ID) does not appear to be used in any unsanitized database operations or returned in
    responses, limiting injection risks.</li>
  <li>Checking the authentication token and validating the user ID cannot be the same as the authenticated user ID helps
    prevent unauthorized modifications.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">One positive security measure is that a user cannot archive or
    delete themselves.</span></p>
<h2>5. Code Logic Evaluation</h2>
<p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code logic is straightforward and easy to follow:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Parameters are validated first.</li>
  <li>Authentication is checked next.</li>
  <li>Then the database operation is performed via the UserService.</li>
  <li>Finally, the appropriate response is returned.</li>
</ul>
<p>One note is that the archive endpoint uses PATCH while the delete endpoint uses DELETE. While not necessarily an
  issue, using PATCH for both (with the action specified in the body) or using a common base endpoint like
  /user/{id}/status could make the API more consistent and flexible.</p>
<h2>6. Estimation Time</h2>
<p>For an experienced developer familiar with the codebase, implementing these two endpoints would likely take in the
  range of <span style="background-color:green;color:white;">2-4 hours</span>, including writing the code, adding
  Swagger documentation, and basic testing.</p>
<p>The time could extend towards the higher end of that range or potentially up to a full day if the developer needs to
  also make matching frontend changes, write comprehensive tests, and/or go through a thorough code review and QA
  process as part of completing the ticket.</p>
