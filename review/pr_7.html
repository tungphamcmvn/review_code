<h1>Pull Request Analysis</h1>
<h2>1. Pull Request Title</h2>
<p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The pull request implements API endpoints for archiving and deleting
  users. It adds new Swagger documentation, route handlers, and service methods to support these user management
  actions.</p>
<p>Suggested Pull Request Title: "Implement User Archive and Delete API Endpoints"</p>
<h2>2. Architecture Alignment</h2>
<p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes align well with the existing application architecture. New
  route handlers are added under src/app/api/user/[id]/ for archive and delete actions. The UserService class is
  extended with corresponding methods. Swagger documentation is updated to include the new endpoints.</p>
<p>The modifications adhere to the separation of concerns principle, with route handlers in the app/api directory,
  service methods in backend/services, and Swagger docs in lib/swagger/doc.</p>
<h2>3. Best Practices Assessment</h2>
<p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code follows Next.js and React.js best practices. It uses async/await
  for handling asynchronous operations, implements error handling with custom exception classes, and utilizes dependency
  injection for the UserService.</p>
<p style="background-color:red;color:white;">Consider extracting the repeated code for handling the user's own
  archive/delete actions into a separate middleware or helper function to improve code reusability.</p>
<p>Example:
<pre> async function validateUserAction(userId: string, action: string) { if (dataDecode && dataDecode.id === userId) { responseStruct.setStatus(400); responseStruct.pushError(`You cannot ${action} yourself.`); return NextResponse.json(responseStruct.getResponse(), { status: 400 }); } } </pre>
</p>
<h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
<p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes do not introduce any significant performance or security
  concerns. The use of MongoDB's updateMany and deleteMany methods ensures efficient database operations.</p>
<p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code validates user input by checking for the presence of the user ID
  parameter and handles potential errors gracefully.</p>
<h2>5. Code Logic Evaluation</h2>
<p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code logic is clear and easy to follow. It validates the user ID,
  checks if the user is trying to archive/delete themselves, and handles errors appropriately.</p>
<p>The UserService class is extended with singleUpdateOrDelete and bulkUpdateOrDelete methods to handle individual and
  bulk user actions respectively. The Actions enum is used to specify the desired action.</p>
<h2>6. Estimation Time</h2>
<p>Estimated development time for a senior developer: 2-4 hours</p>
<p>This includes: - Implementing the new API routes and Swagger documentation - Extending the UserService class with
  archive and delete methods - Writing unit tests for the new functionality - Performing code review and addressing any
  feedback </p>
<p style="background-color:green;color:white;">Overall, the pull request is well-structured, follows best practices, and
  aligns with the existing architecture. With a few minor improvements, it can be confidently merged into the codebase.
