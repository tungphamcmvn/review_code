  <h1>Pull Request Title</h1>
  <p>The pull request titled "J2C-120 API for User Management - Delete/Archive" introduces new API endpoints and
    functionality for deleting and archiving users in the application.</p>
  <h1>Architecture Alignment</h1>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The modifications in 'diff.txt' align well with the described
    application architecture. The changes are appropriately located in the 'src/app/api/' directory for backend API
    endpoints, 'src/backend/services/' for business logic, and 'src/utils/enums.ts' for defining enums used across the
    application.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The database schema is not directly impacted by these changes, as the
    modifications focus on API endpoints and user management functionality.</p>
  <h1>Best Practices Assessment</h1>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code changes adhere to Next.js and React.js best practices. The API
    routes are defined using the recommended directory structure and follow the proper naming conventions.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code utilizes TypeScript for type safety and includes appropriate
    error handling and validation.</p>
  <p>One suggestion for improvement:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">Consider extracting the token decoding logic in the API routes into a
      separate middleware or utility function to avoid code duplication and improve maintainability.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Performance and Security</h1>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The modifications do not introduce any significant performance
    concerns. The API endpoints efficiently handle user deletion and archiving operations without unnecessary
    computations or database queries.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code includes appropriate authorization checks using JWT tokens to
    ensure only authorized users can perform deletion and archiving actions.</p>
  <p>One suggestion for enhancement:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider implementing rate limiting or throttling for the API endpoints to prevent abuse and protect against
      potential security threats.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Code Logic Evaluation</h1>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code logic in the API routes and service methods is clear and easy
    to follow. The routes handle the necessary validation, error handling, and database operations effectively.</p>
  <p>A few observations and suggestions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The code includes appropriate checks to prevent users from deleting or archiving themselves, enhancing the
      overall user management functionality.</li>
    <li>The 'UserService' class is updated to include methods for single user deletion and archiving, promoting code
      reusability and maintainability.</li>
    <li>Consider adding more detailed error messages or logging statements to assist in debugging and troubleshooting.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Estimation Time</h1>
  <p>Based on the scope and complexity of the changes, a senior developer would likely require approximately 4-6 hours
    to implement this pull request. This estimation includes time for code development, testing, and documentation.</p>
