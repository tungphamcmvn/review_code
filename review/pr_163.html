  <h1>Pull Request Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Pull Request Title</h2>
  <p> Update permission to switch company when user was rejected (#J2C-401) </p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;"> The pull request title clearly summarizes the purpose of the change,
    which is to update permissions related to a user switching companies after being rejected. The Jira ticket number is
    included for reference. </p>
  <h2>2. Architecture Alignment</h2>
  <p> Based on the limited diff provided, the changes appear to be focused on the authentication logic in
    <code>src/auth.ts</code>. The authentication flow uses NextAuth.js with credential and Google OAuth providers, and
    includes custom signIn and session callbacks. </p>
  <p> The changes align with the overall application architecture described, utilizing the existing UserRepository,
    JoinedCompanyService, ProjectService, and CacheHandler from the backend services. No discrepancies were found in the
    diff related to the architecture or db schema. </p>
  <h2>3. Best Practices Assessment</h2>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;"> The code follows Next.js and React.js best practices, including: -
    Using environment variables for sensitive configuration - Separating concerns with modular imports and configuration
    files - Implementing middleware for authentication and authorization - Utilizing TypeScript for type safety and
    better code maintainability - Structuring the application with clear separation of backend services, repositories,
    models, and frontend components </p>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
  <p> The changes in the diff do not appear to have a significant impact on performance. The authentication flow uses
    JWT tokens with a configurable maxAge for session management, which is a standard approach. </p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;"> The code incorporates security best practices by: - Using bcrypt for
    password hashing and comparison - Implementing rate limiting for failed login attempts - Locking user accounts after
    exceeding maximum failed attempts - Validating user status and email confirmation before authentication </p>
  <h2>5. Code Logic Evaluation</h2>
  <p> The code logic in the signIn callback of <code>src/auth.ts</code> handles different scenarios based on the
    authentication provider and user data: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>For Google OAuth, it allows sign-in for new accounts and passes to getOrCreateNewUser</li>
    <li>For existing users, it performs additional checks and updates related to joined companies, project roles, and
      cache invalidation</li>
    <li>It handles locked user accounts due to maximum failed login attempts</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:red;color:white;"> One potential issue is the lack of error handling for database queries
    and cache operations. Adding proper try-catch blocks and error logging would improve robustness. </p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;"> The code follows a logical flow and incorporates necessary checks for
    user status, email confirmation, and authentication provider. The use of async/await and TypeScript enhances code
    readability and maintainability. </p>
  <h2>6. Estimation Time</h2>
  <p> Considering the complexity of the authentication flow and the integration with NextAuth.js, a senior developer
    would likely require 3-5 hours to develop and test these changes, including: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implementing the signIn callback logic</li>
    <li>Integrating with UserRepository, JoinedCompanyService, ProjectService, and CacheHandler</li>
    <li>Handling different authentication providers and user scenarios</li>
    <li>Adding necessary error handling and logging</li>
    <li>Writing unit tests to cover the authentication flow</li>
  </ul>
