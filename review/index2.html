  <h1>Git Commit Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Commit Purpose Summary</h2>
  <p class="positive">
    The commit applies changes to display the user's first name and last name instead of the full name, and shows the
    user's avatar image. It also capitalizes the user status text. This improves the user detail and listing pages to
    provide more structured user information.
  </p>
  <p>Suggested commit message:</p>
  <pre>
  Display user first name, last name, and avatar image

Update user detail page to show first name and last name in separate fields

Show user avatar image on user detail and listing pages

Capitalize user status text

Adjust user type to include first name and last name
</pre>

  <h2>2. Alignment with Application Architecture</h2>
  <p class="positive"> The changes align well with the described application architecture. The modifications are scoped
    to the relevant user detail and listing components under <code>src/components/user</code> and the user type
    definition at <code>src/types/resource/user.ts</code>. No changes to the overall architecture are needed. </p>
  <h2>3. Adherence to Coding Best Practices</h2>
  <p class="positive"> The code follows React best practices by:
  <ul>
    <li>Using functional components (<code>BasicInformation</code>, <code>User</code>)</li>
    <li>Keeping components focused with clear props and responsibilities</li>
    <li>Styling components with inline styles and class names</li>
    <li>Updating the TypeScript user type to match the new shape</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p class="negative"> One suggestion would be to extract the inline <code>sx</code> prop styles in
    <code>BasicInformation</code> to a separate style object for better readability:
  <pre>
const statusFieldStyles = {
'& input': {
textTransform: 'capitalize'
}
};
</pre>
  Then apply it as:
  <pre>
<TextField
...
sx={statusFieldStyles}
/>
</pre>
  </p>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security Considerations</h2>
  <p class="positive">
    The changes do not introduce any new API calls or expensive operations, so performance should not be impacted.
    Rendering the avatar image could slightly increase page load time, but using an optimized image size would mitigate
    this.
  </p>
  <p class="positive">
    There are no apparent security issues introduced by these UI changes. The code does not directly interact with APIs
    or user-provided data in an unsafe way.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Development Time Estimate</h2>
  <p>
    For a senior React developer familiar with the codebase, implementing these changes would likely take in the range
    of <strong>1-2 hours</strong>, including:
  <ul>
    <li>Updating the user detail fields (~30 minutes)</li>
    <li>Adding the avatar image (~30 minutes)</li>
    <li>Adjusting the user type and prop usage (~30 minutes)</li>
    <li>Brief testing and code review (~30 minutes)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
