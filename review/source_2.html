  <h1>Source Code Analysis</h1>
  <h2>Source Title</h2>
  <p>Based on the provided <code>codebase.txt</code>, this application appears to be a comprehensive Next.js, React.js,
    and MongoDB web application. It includes end-to-end functionality such as user authentication (via credentials and
    Google OAuth), authorization middleware, MongoDB database integration, API routes, UI components, and more.</p>
  <p>A suitable pull request title summarizing the changes could be: "Full-stack Next.js App with Auth, MongoDB, Custom
    Middleware & UI Components"</p>
  <h2>Architecture Alignment</h2>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The codebase structure and functionality aligns well with the described
    application architecture. It follows a modular approach, separating concerns into logical directories like backend
    services, repositories, models, API routes, UI components, utility functions, etc.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The usage of Next.js for server-side rendering, API routes, and
    client-side logic, along with React.js for building UI components, matches the architecture description. The
    integration with MongoDB for data storage also fits the specified stack.</p>
  <p>One potential improvement could be to provide more details in <code>dbschema.txt</code> about the MongoDB schema
    definitions to ensure a complete understanding of the data model.</p>
  <h2>Best Practices Assessment</h2>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The codebase generally follows good practices for Next.js and React.js
    development. It utilizes TypeScript for type safety, implements proper error handling with custom exceptions, and
    modularizes code into reusable components and services.</p>
  <p style="background-color:red;color:white;">However, there are a few areas that could be improved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider using more descriptive names for some variables and functions to enhance code readability.</li>
    <li>Add more comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code sections.</li>
    <li>Ensure consistent formatting and indentation throughout the codebase.</li>
    <li>Use more specific types instead of <code>any</code> to improve type safety.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Performance and Security</h2>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The codebase demonstrates attention to performance by utilizing Next.js
    features like server-side rendering, API routes, and image optimization. The modular imports for libraries like
    <code>@mui/material</code> can help reduce bundle size.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">Security measures are implemented through authentication middleware,
    password hashing, and using environment variables for sensitive information.</p>
  <p>Some suggestions for further optimization and security:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to improve performance.</li>
    <li>Consider adding rate limiting for API routes to prevent abuse.</li>
    <li>Regularly update dependencies to ensure the latest security patches are applied.</li>
    <li>Implement more granular authorization checks based on user roles and permissions.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Code Logic Evaluation</h2>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code logic in the provided codebase appears to be well-structured
    and follows a modular approach. The separation of concerns into services, repositories, and API routes promotes
    maintainability and reusability.</p>
  <p>However, there are a few areas that could be improved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">In <code>src/auth.ts</code>, the <code>jwt</code> and
      <code>session</code> callbacks have complex logic that could be extracted into separate functions for better
      readability.</li>
    <li>Some error handling could be more specific and provide more informative error messages to aid in debugging.</li>
    <li>Consider adding more validation and sanitization for user inputs to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Estimation Time</h2>
  <p>Based on the scope and complexity of the changes in <code>codebase.txt</code>, a senior developer would likely
    require approximately 2-3 weeks to develop and test this pull request. This estimation takes into account the
    implementation of various features such as authentication, authorization, database integration, API routes, UI
    components, and overall application setup.</p>
  <p>However, the actual time may vary depending on factors such as the developer's familiarity with the specific
    technologies used, the availability of clear requirements and specifications, and any unforeseen challenges or
    additional features that may arise during development.</p>
