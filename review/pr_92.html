  <h1>Pull Request Title:</h1>
  <p>Implement API endpoint to retrieve user roles for a specific company</p>
  <h1>Architecture Alignment:</h1>
  <p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The modifications in 'diff.txt' align with the described
      application architecture and directory structure.</span> The changes are focused on adding a new API endpoint in
    the backend services to retrieve user roles for a specific company, which fits well within the existing
    architecture.</p>
  <h1>Best Practices Assessment:</h1>
  <p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code changes adhere to Next.js and React.js coding standards
      and best practices.</span> The new API endpoint is implemented in a modular and reusable manner, following the
    existing patterns in the codebase.</p>
  <p><span style="background-color:red;color:white;">Consider adding appropriate error handling and validation for the
      API endpoint to ensure robustness and security.</span> Implement necessary checks for user authentication and
    authorization before returning the user roles.</p>
  <h1>Performance and Security:</h1>
  <p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The modifications do not introduce any significant performance or
      security concerns.</span> The API endpoint retrieves user roles efficiently by querying the database based on the
    provided company key.</p>
  <p><span style="background-color:red;color:white;">Consider implementing caching mechanisms to improve performance if
      the user roles data is frequently accessed.</span> This can help reduce the load on the database and provide
    faster response times.</p>
  <h1>Code Logic Evaluation:</h1>
  <p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code logic for retrieving user roles based on the company key
      is clear and straightforward.</span> It utilizes the existing JoinedCompanyService to fetch the user's joined
    companies and filters the roles based on the provided company key.</p>
  <p><span style="background-color:red;color:white;">Consider adding appropriate error handling and logging statements
      to track any issues or exceptions that may occur during the API request processing.</span> This will help in
    debugging and monitoring the system.</p>
  <h1>Estimation Time:</h1>
  <p>Based on the scope of the changes and the complexity involved, a senior developer would typically require around
    2-4 hours to develop this pull request. This includes implementing the API endpoint, writing necessary tests, and
    ensuring proper integration with the existing codebase.</p>
