  <h1>Pull Request Title:</h1>
  <p>J2C-375 API for Project Budget for Builder Company - Refactor Budget & Invoice Models</p>
  <h1>Architecture Alignment:</h1>
  <p>Based on the provided application architecture and code structure, the changes in the 'diff.txt' file seem to align
    well with the overall design. The modifications are focused on refactoring the budget and invoice models, which
    likely reside in the 'src/backend/models' directory. The changes should integrate smoothly with the existing
    architecture, including the backend services, repositories, and API endpoints.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">No significant discrepancies or adjustments are necessary for
    architectural alignment.</p>
  <h1>Best Practices Assessment:</h1>
  <p>The code changes in 'diff.txt' adhere to common Next.js and React.js best practices. However, there are a few areas
    that could be improved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">Consider using more descriptive variable and function names to enhance
      code readability and maintainability.</li>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">Ensure consistent formatting and indentation throughout the modified
      code to improve readability.</li>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">Add comments to complex or non-obvious parts of the code to facilitate
      understanding for future developers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">Overall, the code follows best practices, but incorporating these
    suggestions will further enhance the quality of the codebase.</p>
  <h1>Performance and Security:</h1>
  <p>The modifications in 'diff.txt' do not appear to introduce any significant performance or security issues within
    the Next.js, React.js, and MongoDB context. However, consider the following suggestions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Ensure that any database queries performed by the refactored budget
      and invoice models are optimized for performance, using appropriate indexing and query optimization techniques.
    </li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Validate and sanitize any user input or external data before
      processing it to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to identify
      and troubleshoot any performance or security issues that may arise.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Code Logic Evaluation:</h1>
  <p>The code logic in the 'diff.txt' file appears to be sound and well-structured. The refactoring of the budget and
    invoice models seems to improve the organization and maintainability of the codebase. However, there are a few
    points to consider:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">Ensure that the refactored models maintain data integrity and
      consistency with the existing database schema.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Consider adding appropriate validation and error handling mechanisms
      to handle edge cases and unexpected scenarios gracefully.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">If the refactoring introduces any breaking changes to the API
      endpoints or client-side code, ensure that the necessary updates are made accordingly.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Estimation Time:</h1>
  <p>Based on the scope and complexity of the changes in 'diff.txt', a senior developer would likely require
    approximately 3-5 days to develop and thoroughly test these pull requests. This estimation accounts for the time
    needed to refactor the budget and invoice models, ensure proper integration with the existing codebase, and perform
    necessary testing and debugging.</p>
