  <h1>Pull Request Title:</h1>
  <p>Based on the modifications in 'diff.txt', an appropriate pull request title would be:</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">J2C-377: Add project invoice listing functionality</p>
  <h1>Architecture Alignment:</h1>
  <p>The changes in 'diff.txt' appear to be focused on a specific task related to listing project invoices. The
    modifications do not seem to introduce any significant architectural changes or deviations from the described
    application structure and database schema.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The pull request aligns with the existing architecture and does not
    require any major adjustments.</p>
  <h1>Best Practices Assessment:</h1>
  <p>Based on the limited information provided in 'diff.txt', it is difficult to assess the adherence to Next.js and
    React.js best practices comprehensively. However, a few observations can be made:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The pull request title follows a clear and descriptive format, including the ticket number and a brief summary
      of the changes.</li>
    <li>The modifications seem to be focused on a specific feature or task, which aligns with the principle of making
      small, incremental changes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">Overall, the changes appear to follow good practices, but a more
    detailed review of the actual code changes would be necessary to provide further recommendations.</p>
  <h1>Performance and Security:</h1>
  <p>Based on the limited information in 'diff.txt', it is challenging to assess the performance and security
    implications of the changes. However, a few general considerations can be made:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When implementing the project invoice listing functionality, it is important to ensure that the database queries
      are optimized and efficient to avoid performance issues.</li>
    <li>Proper access controls and authentication mechanisms should be in place to restrict access to project invoices
      based on user roles and permissions.</li>
    <li>Sensitive data, such as invoice details, should be handled securely and encrypted if necessary.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">It is recommended to conduct thorough performance testing and security
    audits to identify and address any potential issues related to the new functionality.</p>
  <h1>Code Logic Evaluation:</h1>
  <p>Without access to the actual code changes, it is not possible to provide a detailed evaluation of the code logic.
    However, based on the pull request title and the limited information in 'diff.txt', the following assumptions can be
    made:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The changes likely involve retrieving project invoices from the database and displaying them in a user-friendly
      manner.</li>
    <li>The code logic should handle scenarios such as pagination, filtering, and sorting of invoices to provide a
      smooth user experience.</li>
    <li>Error handling and proper validations should be implemented to handle edge cases and prevent unexpected
      behavior.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:red;color:white;">A thorough code review is necessary to identify any potential issues or
    areas for improvement in the code logic.</p>
  <h1>Estimation Time:</h1>
  <p>Based on the complexity of the project invoice listing functionality and the size of the codebase, a senior
    developer may require approximately <strong>2-4 days</strong> to develop this pull request. This estimation takes
    into account the time needed for implementing the necessary API endpoints, database queries, frontend components,
    and testing.</p>
  <p>However, please note that this is a rough estimation, and the actual development time may vary depending on the
    specific requirements, the developer's familiarity with the codebase, and any unforeseen challenges that may arise
    during the implementation process.</p>
