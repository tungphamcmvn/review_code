<h2>Pull Request Title</h2>
<p style="background-color:green;color:white;">Fix incorrect docker command in README.md</p>
<p>The pull request fixes an incorrect docker command in the README.md file for running the application in production
  mode. Specifically, it moves the --build flag to the correct position when starting the containers and removes it from
  the stop command.</p>
<h2>Architecture Alignment</h2>
<p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes are limited to the README.md file and do not impact the
  overall application architecture or database schema described in 'codebase.txt' and 'dbschema.txt'. The fix aligns
  with the existing setup instructions and does not introduce any discrepancies.</p>
<h2>Best Practices Assessment</h2>
<p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The modifications adhere to best practices for providing clear and
  accurate instructions in the README.md file. The corrected docker commands follow the proper syntax and usage of
