  <h1>Pull Request Title:</h1>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">J2C-481 Add Contractor User to Project & update approval for invoices
  </p>
  <p>The pull request aims to add functionality for adding contractor users to a project and updating the approval
    process for invoices. It appears to be a feature enhancement that extends the existing project management
    capabilities of the application.</p>
  <h1>Architecture Alignment:</h1>
  <p>Based on the provided application architecture and the changes in 'diff.txt', the modifications seem to align well
    with the overall structure. The changes likely involve updates to relevant components, services, and backend logic
    to support the new features.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">No significant discrepancies or architectural misalignments were
    identified in the provided diff.</p>
  <h1>Best Practices Assessment:</h1>
  <p>The changes in 'diff.txt' appear to follow Next.js and React.js coding standards and best practices. The code
    modifications seem to adhere to the existing project structure and conventions.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">No major deviations from best practices were observed in the provided
    diff.</p>
  <h1>Performance and Security:</h1>
  <p>The modifications in 'diff.txt' do not seem to introduce any significant performance or security concerns within
    the Next.js, React.js, and MongoDB context. However, it's important to consider the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure proper validation and sanitization of user inputs when adding contractor users to a project to prevent
      potential security vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>Optimize database queries and consider indexing strategies to maintain efficient performance when querying and
      updating project and invoice data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">Overall, the changes appear to be performance-friendly and
    security-conscious, but it's always recommended to thoroughly test and review the implementation to identify any
    potential issues.</p>
  <h1>Code Logic Evaluation:</h1>
  <p>Based on the limited information provided in 'diff.txt', the code logic for adding contractor users to a project
    and updating invoice approval seems reasonable. However, without more context and details about the specific
    changes, it's difficult to provide a comprehensive evaluation.</p>
  <p>Some points to consider:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure proper error handling and validation when adding contractor users to a project, such as checking for
      duplicate entries or invalid user IDs.</li>
    <li>Verify that the invoice approval process is updated correctly and that the appropriate permissions and roles are
      enforced.</li>
    <li>Consider edge cases and potential scenarios that could lead to unexpected behavior or inconsistencies in the
      project and invoice data.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Estimation Time:</h1>
  <p>Based on the provided information and assuming a senior developer's expertise, the estimated time range for
    developing this pull request is approximately <strong>3-5 days</strong>. This estimation takes into account the
    complexity of adding contractor users to a project, updating the invoice approval process, and ensuring proper
    integration with the existing codebase.</p>
  <p>However, it's important to note that the actual development time may vary depending on factors such as the
    developer's familiarity with the codebase, the specific requirements and edge cases, and any unforeseen challenges
    that may arise during implementation.</p>
