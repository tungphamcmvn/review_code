  <h1>Git Commit Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Commit Purpose</h2>
  <p>The git diff shows changes to the README.md file to correct the docker commands for starting and stopping the
    application in production mode. Specifically:</p>
  <div class="recommendation">
    <p>Commit Message: "Fix incorrect docker commands in README for running in production mode"</p>
  </div>
  <h2>2. Alignment with Application Architecture</h2>
  <div class="recommendation">
    <p>The changes made in the git diff align properly with the Next.js, React, and MongoDB application architecture
      described. The README provides instructions for launching the dockerized application, which matches the expected
      setup. No adjustments appear necessary.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>3. Adherence to Coding Best Practices</h2>
  <div class="recommendation">
    <p>The modifications in the git diff follow coding best practices. The README uses proper markdown formatting, the
      docker commands are clear and readable, and the overall changes are focused and coherent. No best practice
      improvements needed.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
  <div class="issue">
    <p>One potential security issue is that the docker-compose files referenced (docker-compose.yml and
      docker-compose.prod.yml) may contain sensitive configuration information like database credentials or API keys.
      These should not be committed to version control.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="recommendation">
    <p>Recommendation: Sensitive config should be moved into environment variables or a separate non-committed env file
      that is referenced by docker-compose. The README can provide instructions on what env variables need to be
      populated prior to launching with docker-compose.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>5. Development Time Estimate</h2>
  <div class="recommendation">
    <p>Fixing incorrect documentation like this is a quick task for a senior developer, likely taking no more than 15-30
      minutes including testing the commands to verify correctness.</p>
