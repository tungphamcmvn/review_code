  <h1>Git Commit Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Commit Message</h2>
  <p>The commit made the following changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Added new API endpoint for bulk user control actions (activate, deactivate, delete)</li>
    <li>Refactored DateUTC to DateCustom in invoice mock data</li>
    <li>Fixed _id handling in MongoDB model schemas</li>
    <li>Excluded current user from user listing API response</li>
    <li>Added authorization check to user bulk control and listing endpoints</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="positive">Commit message suggestion: "Add user bulk actions API, refactor date handling, fix schemas,
    exclude self from user list, add auth checks"</p>
  <h2>2. Application Architecture Alignment</h2>
  <p>The changes mostly align well with the intended application architecture:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>New API endpoint added under src/app/api/user/bulk-control/route.ts as expected</li>
    <li>Utilized backend services, repositories, validators appropriately</li>
    <li>Authorization checks added using NextAuth JWT decoding</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="negative">One inconsistency noticed:<br> The IdsNotFoundException is defined but not leveraged in the user
    bulk actions API. The 400 status is returned regardless of the error type. Consider throwing this exception in the
    service layer when IDs are not found, and catch it in the API to return a more specific 400 error. </p>
  <h2>3. Coding Best Practices</h2>
  <p>The code follows most Next.js, React and MongoDB best practices, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>API routes organized under src/app/api</li>
    <li>Backend logic separated into services and repositories</li>
    <li>Input validation performed using validator classes</li>
    <li>Database calls made asynchronously using async/await</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="negative">A few areas for improvement:<br> - The bulk user actions API could benefit from more granular
    error handling, throwing specific errors for different failure scenarios<br> - Some of the mongoose model
    definitions ({ _id: false }) look incorrect and should use { _id: true }<br> - Inconsistent naming of
    interfaces/types (e.g. BudgetType vs IInvoice), settle on a standard like IModelName </p>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
  <p>The changes consider performance and security in a few ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Authorization implemented on sensitive endpoints</li>
    <li>Database calls are asynchronous to avoid blocking</li>
    <li>Indexing opportunities exist on fields used for filtering</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="positive">To further improve performance and security:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement request rate limiting on the APIs to prevent abuse</li>
    <li>Add server-side input validation/sanitization in addition to type checking</li>
    <li>Consider database or object caching for expensive, frequently accessed data</li>
    <li>Ensure error messages don't leak sensitive system details to the client</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>5. Development Time Estimate</h2>
  <p>For an experienced senior developer familiar with the stack, these changes would likely take in the range of <span
      class="positive">4-6 hours</span> to implement, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>~1 hour for the new bulk actions API endpoint</li>
    <li>~1 hour for authorization and current user exclusion changes</li>
    <li>~2 hours for model and DTO refactoring</li>
    <li>~1 hour for testing and validation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The estimate could vary depending on the complexity of the existing codebase and any merge conflicts or
    compatibility issues encountered.</p>
