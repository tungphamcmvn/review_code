  <h1>Git Commit Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Commit Summary</h2>
  <p>The commit makes several changes related to the Builder model and API endpoints:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Updates the Swagger documentation for the GET and PUT endpoints of the Builder API to fix parameter names and
      remove unnecessary response fields.</li>
    <li>Refactors the PUT endpoint handler to only return success status instead of the updated builder object.</li>
    <li>Rewrites the GET endpoint handler to use a new listBuilders method in the BuilderService.</li>
    <li>Implements the listBuilders method to support pagination, sorting and searching of builders with proper DTO
      mapping.</li>
    <li>Updates the BuilderDeleteDialog and BuilderDialog components to use the new API response format.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="positive">The commit message could be something like: "Refactor Builder API endpoints and service methods
    for improved querying and response handling"</p>
  <h2>2. Application Architecture Alignment</h2>
  <p>The changes align well with the described application architecture:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>API endpoint handlers are located in the src/app/api directory and separated by model (builder).</li>
    <li>The BuilderService in src/backend/services encapsulates the core logic and repository interactions.</li>
    <li>DTOs are used to map between API requests/responses and database objects.</li>
    <li>UI components for builders are located in src/components/builder.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="positive">No major adjustments to the application structure seem necessary based on this commit.</p>
  <h2>3. Best Practices</h2>
  <p>The code follows many best practices, but a few things could be improved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="negative">The listBuilders method is quite long. Consider extracting some of the logic for pagination,
      sorting, searching into separate methods to improve readability.</li>
    <li class="negative">Be consistent with error handling. The GET endpoint handler uses a try/catch and returns
      different status codes, while the PUT handler just returns 400. Standardize this across endpoints.</li>
    <li>Consider validating the sort order fields passed to listBuilders to avoid potential injection issues.</li>
    <li class="positive">Using a PaginationStruct and separate DTO mapping is a good practice to keep the API responses
      clean and consistent.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
  <p>The changes have a few positive impacts on performance and security:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="positive">Using pagination, filtering and sorting in listBuilders will help limit the amount of data
      loaded and improve response times.</li>
    <li class="positive">Removing unnecessary fields like creatorId from the PUT response reduces response size.</li>
    <li>Consider adding rate limiting middleware to the API endpoints to prevent abuse.</li>
    <li>Ensure all user input is properly validated and sanitized, especially for search and sort parameters.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>5. Development Time Estimate</h2>
  <p>For an experienced senior developer familiar with the codebase, these changes would likely take in the range of 4-6
    hours to implement, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>~1 hour to update the Swagger documentation and API endpoint handlers</li>
    <li>~2-3 hours to implement the listBuilders method with pagination, sorting, filtering</li>
    <li>~1 hour to update the affected UI components and test the changes</li>
  </ul>
