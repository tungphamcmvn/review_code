  <h1>Pull Request Title: Set up service worker and notification layout for realtime notifications</h1>
  <h1>Architecture Alignment</h1>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes in diff.txt appear to be focused on the client-side of the
    application and do not make any modifications to the overall application architecture or database schema described
    in codebase.txt. The addition of a service worker for realtime notifications aligns with the existing client-side
    architecture and does not introduce any discrepancies.</p>
  <h1>Best Practices Assessment</h1>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code changes follow Next.js and React.js best practices. The use of
    a service worker for handling realtime notifications is a recommended approach for progressive web apps (PWAs). The
    code is modular and follows a clear separation of concerns.</p>
  <p>To further improve the code, consider the following suggestions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add error handling and fallback mechanisms for cases where the service worker registration fails or is not
      supported by the browser.</li>
    <li>Implement proper versioning and caching strategies for the service worker to ensure smooth updates and offline
      functionality.</li>
    <li>Add comments or documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of the service worker and notification
      layout components.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Performance and Security</h1>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The introduction of a service worker for realtime notifications should
    not have a significant impact on the overall application performance. Service workers run in the background and do
    not block the main thread, allowing for efficient handling of notifications.</p>
  <p>To optimize performance and ensure security, consider the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement proper caching strategies for the service worker to minimize network requests and improve load times.
    </li>
    <li>Ensure that the service worker code is properly scoped and has limited access to sensitive data or APIs.</li>
    <li>Validate and sanitize any data received through the service worker to prevent potential security
      vulnerabilities.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Code Logic Evaluation</h1>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code logic for setting up the service worker and handling
    notifications appears to be sound. The service worker is registered, and event listeners are set up to handle
    incoming notifications.</p>
  <p>Suggestions for improvement:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider adding more robust error handling and logging mechanisms to track and diagnose any issues related to
      the service worker or notifications.</li>
    <li>Implement a mechanism to update the notification UI in real-time when new notifications are received, ensuring a
      seamless user experience.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Estimation Time</h1>
  <p>Based on the scope of the changes and assuming familiarity with Next.js, React.js, and service workers, a senior
    developer should be able to implement these pull requests within <strong>2-3 days</strong>. This estimation includes
    time for development, testing, and potential iterations based on feedback.</p>
