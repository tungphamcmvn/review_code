    <h2>3. Coding Best Practices</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Using CSS modules (style.module.scss) for component-specific styles to avoid global style conflicts.</li>
      <li>Keeping the component file (ContractorDialog.tsx) focused on the component logic and importing styles
        separately.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>No corrections or improvements are needed in terms of coding best practices.</p>
