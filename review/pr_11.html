  <h1>Pull Request Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Pull Request Title</h2>
  <p>The pull request titled "J2C-116 Change name to first name and last name for user & refactor response struct"
    focuses on two main changes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Modifying the user model to use separate fields for first name and last name instead of a single name field.
    </li>
    <li>Refactoring the API response structure to follow a consistent format using a ResponseStruct class.</li>
  </ol>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The pull request title effectively summarizes the key changes and
    aligns with the modifications observed in the diff.</p>
  <h2>2. Architecture Alignment</h2>
  <p>The changes in the diff align well with the described application architecture and database schema:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The user model is updated to include separate fields for firstName and lastName, which is consistent with the
      MongoDB schema defined in dbschema.txt.</li>
    <li>The API response structure is refactored using a ResponseStruct class, which follows the pattern of using
      structs for common API response formats as mentioned in the codebase overview.</li>
    <li>The modifications are made in the appropriate directories, such as src/app/api/ for API routes and
      src/backend/structs/ for the response struct.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes adhere to the overall architecture and do not introduce any
    discrepancies.</p>
  <h2>3. Best Practices Assessment</h2>
  <p>The changes in the diff generally follow best practices for Next.js and React.js development:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The API routes are organized by model or functionality, promoting a modular and maintainable structure.</li>
    <li>The ResponseStruct class is used to enforce a consistent response format across API endpoints, enhancing code
      readability and maintainability.</li>
    <li>Error handling is implemented using custom exception classes, providing a structured approach to error
      management.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code modifications demonstrate adherence to best practices and
    contribute to a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.</p>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
  <p>The changes in the diff do not introduce any significant performance or security concerns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Splitting the name field into separate firstName and lastName fields does not have a notable impact on
      performance.</li>
    <li>The refactored response structure using ResponseStruct improves code organization and maintainability without
      affecting performance.</li>
    <li>The modifications do not introduce any security vulnerabilities or weaknesses.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes are performance-neutral and maintain the security posture
    of the application.</p>
  <h2>5. Code Logic Evaluation</h2>
  <p>The code logic in the diff is sound and follows a consistent pattern:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The user registration API route is updated to accept firstName and lastName fields, and the AuthService is
      modified to handle the separate fields when creating a new user.</li>
    <li>The ResponseStruct class is used consistently across API routes to structure the response data, including status
      codes, success flags, errors, and data payloads.</li>
    <li>Error handling is centralized using custom exception classes, promoting a consistent approach to error
      management.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code logic is well-structured, easy to understand, and aligns with
    the intended functionality.</p>
  <h2>6. Estimation Time</h2>
  <p>For a senior developer, the estimated time to develop the changes in this pull request would be in the range of 2-4
    hours. The modifications involve updating the user model, refactoring the response structure across multiple API
    routes, and ensuring consistency throughout the codebase. While the changes are not complex, they require careful
    attention to detail and thorough testing to ensure the desired functionality is achieved without introducing any
    regressions.</p>
