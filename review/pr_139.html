  <h1>Pull Request Title:</h1>
  <p>J2C-374 Update get role permission company & project scope</p>
  <h1>Architecture Alignment:</h1>
  <p>Based on the provided 'diff.txt' and 'codebase.txt' files, the changes align with the described application
    architecture and functionality. The modifications seem to be focused on updating the role permission for the company
    and project scope, which falls under the role-based access control implemented in the src/backend/services and
    src/utils directories.</p>
  <p>No major discrepancies or architectural misalignments were identified in the changes.</p>
  <h1>Best Practices Assessment:</h1>
  <p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes adhere to Next.js and React.js coding standards and
      best practices.</span> The code follows a modular structure, with separation of concerns between different layers
    (middleware, services, repositories).</p>
  <p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The use of TypeScript provides type safety and improves code
      maintainability.</span></p>
  <p>No significant violations of best practices were found in the provided code diff.</p>
  <h1>Performance and Security:</h1>
  <p>The changes do not appear to introduce any major performance or security issues within the Next.js, React.js, and
    MongoDB context.</p>
  <p><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The use of middleware functions for authentication and
      authorization checks helps ensure secure access to protected routes and resources.</span></p>
  <p>However, it's important to thoroughly test the updated role permission functionality to ensure it behaves as
    expected and does not introduce any unintended access control vulnerabilities.</p>
  <h1>Code Logic Evaluation:</h1>
  <p>The code logic in the provided diff appears to be sound and aligned with the purpose of updating role permissions
    for the company and project scope.</p>
  <p>The changes likely involve modifications to the role-related services, middleware, and utility functions to
    incorporate the updated permission checks.</p>
  <p>Without more context or the complete code changes, it's difficult to provide a detailed evaluation of the code
    logic. However, based on the available information, no major issues or improvements were identified.</p>
  <h1>Estimation Time:</h1>
  <p>Assuming the pull request focuses solely on updating the role permission for the company and project scope, and
    considering the complexity of the application architecture, a senior developer would likely require approximately
    4-8 hours to develop and thoroughly test these changes.</p>
  <p>This estimation takes into account the time needed to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the existing codebase and architecture</li>
    <li>Identify the necessary modifications to update the role permission logic</li>
    <li>Implement the changes in the relevant services, middleware, and utility functions</li>
    <li>Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the updated functionality</li>
    <li>Perform manual testing to validate the changes in different scenarios</li>
    <li>Review and refactor the code for readability and maintainability</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, the actual development time may vary depending on the developer's familiarity with the codebase and the
    specific requirements of the role permission update.</p>
