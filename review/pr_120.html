  <h1>Pull Request Title:</h1>
  <p>Based on the diff.txt file, an appropriate title for this pull request could be:</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">J2C-372: Implement API for User Notifications and Move Swagger to Dev
    Dependencies</p>
  <p>This title concisely captures the two main changes being made in the pull request: implementing an API for user
    notifications and moving the Swagger dependency to dev dependencies.</p>
  <h1>Architecture Alignment:</h1>
  <p>The changes made in the diff.txt file appear to align well with the overall application architecture described in
    codebase.txt. The modifications primarily involve changes to dependencies and the implementation of a new API
    endpoint for user notifications.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes do not introduce any discrepancies or conflicts with the
    existing architecture. The new API endpoint fits within the backend services structure, and moving Swagger to dev
    dependencies aligns with best practices for separating development and production dependencies.</p>
  <h1>Best Practices Assessment:</h1>
  <p>The code changes in diff.txt generally adhere to Next.js and React.js best practices. However, there are a few
    areas that could be improved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">The new API endpoint could benefit from more extensive error handling
      and validation to ensure robust and secure functionality.</li>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">The code could be further modularized and split into smaller, reusable
      components to enhance maintainability and readability.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Moving Swagger to dev dependencies is a positive change, as it
      aligns with the best practice of separating development and production dependencies.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Performance and Security:</h1>
  <p>The changes made in diff.txt do not appear to have any significant impact on performance or security within the
    Next.js, React.js, and MongoDB context. However, there are a few considerations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">The new API endpoint for user notifications should be thoroughly
      tested for performance under various load conditions to ensure it can handle the expected traffic.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">Security measures, such as input validation and authentication
      checks, should be implemented to protect the API endpoint from unauthorized access or malicious requests.</li>
    <li>Proper error handling and logging should be added to the API endpoint to aid in troubleshooting and monitoring
      any potential security issues.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Code Logic Evaluation:</h1>
  <p>The code logic introduced in diff.txt for the user notifications API appears to be sound overall. However, there
    are a few areas that could be improved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">The code could benefit from more descriptive variable and function
      names to enhance readability and maintainability.</li>
    <li>The logic could be further optimized to minimize unnecessary database queries or computations.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The introduction of TypeScript types and interfaces would help catch
      potential type-related issues during development and provide better code documentation.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Estimation Time:</h1>
  <p>Based on the scope of the changes made in diff.txt, a senior developer would likely require approximately 4-6 hours
    to develop and test the user notifications API and move Swagger to dev dependencies. This estimation takes into
    account the time needed for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implementing the API endpoint logic</li>
    <li>Writing necessary unit tests</li>
    <li>Updating dependencies and configurations</li>
    <li>Testing the functionality thoroughly</li>
    <li>Addressing any issues or edge cases that may arise during development and testing</li>
  </ul>
