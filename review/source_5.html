  <h1>Code Review</h1>
  <h2>1. Architecture Alignment</h2>
  <p>The code modifications in 'code.txt' align well with the described application architecture built using Next.js,
    React.js, and MongoDB. The changes are focused within the <code>src/backend/services/company</code> directory,
    specifically in the <code>company.service.ts</code> file. This file contains the business logic and service class
    for company-related functionalities, which follows the outlined structure.</p>
  <p>The code interacts with the MongoDB database using the <code>CompanyRepository</code> and leverages other services
    and repositories such as <code>RoleService</code>, <code>StorageFactory</code>, <code>UserRepository</code>, and
    <code>RoleRepository</code>. This aligns with the architecture's separation of concerns and modular design.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code modifications adhere to the described directory structure and
    responsibilities, maintaining a clear separation between backend services, repositories, exceptions, and DTOs.</p>
  <h2>2. Best Practices Assessment</h2>
  <p>The code in 'code.txt' generally follows best practices for Next.js and React.js development. It utilizes
    TypeScript for type safety and includes appropriate type annotations for function parameters and return values. The
    code is organized into separate methods within the <code>CompanyService</code> class, promoting readability and
    maintainability.</p>
  <p>However, there are a few areas that could be improved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">The <code>createCompany</code> method could benefit from better error
      handling. Instead of catching a generic error and rethrowing it, specific error types could be caught and handled
      appropriately.</li>
    <li>The <code>listCompany</code> and <code>listCompanyMembers</code> methods could be refactored to reduce code
      duplication and improve readability. Common logic for pagination and sorting could be extracted into separate
      helper functions.</li>
    <li>The code could make use of more descriptive variable names in some places to enhance code clarity. For example,
      <code>data</code> and <code>currentObject</code> could be renamed to more specific names based on their context.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>3. Performance and Security</h2>
  <p>The code modifications in 'code.txt' do not introduce any significant performance or security concerns within the
    Next.js, React.js, and MongoDB context. However, there are a few points to consider:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <code>listCompany</code> and <code>listCompanyMembers</code> methods perform multiple database queries in a
      loop, which could potentially impact performance if dealing with a large number of companies or members. Consider
      optimizing these queries or using aggregation pipelines to fetch the required data more efficiently.</li>
    <li>Ensure that proper input validation and sanitization are implemented when receiving data from external sources,
      such as user input or API requests, to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting
      (XSS) attacks.</li>
    <li style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code uses the <code>StorageFactory</code> to handle file
      uploads, which is a good practice to separate storage concerns from the core business logic.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>4. Code Logic Evaluation</h2>
  <p>The code logic in 'code.txt' is generally well-structured and follows a clear flow. The <code>CompanyService</code>
    class encapsulates various methods for company-related operations, such as creating a company, adding users to a
    company, updating user fields, listing companies, and listing company members.</p>
  <p>However, there are a few areas where the code logic could be improved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li style="background-color:red;color:white;">In the <code>createCompany</code> method, the position auto-increment
      logic could be simplified by using a MongoDB aggregation query to find the maximum position value and incrementing
      it, instead of fetching the last company and manually incrementing the position.</li>
    <li>The <code>listCompany</code> and <code>listCompanyMembers</code> methods contain similar pagination and sorting
      logic, which could be extracted into reusable helper functions to improve code reusability and maintainability.
    </li>
    <li>The error handling in the <code>addUserToCompany</code> and <code>updateFieldsUserCompany</code> methods could
      be more specific, throwing custom exceptions instead of generic errors to provide better error context.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">Overall, the code logic in 'code.txt' is functional and implements the
    required company-related operations. With some minor improvements in error handling, code reusability, and
    performance optimization, the code can be further enhanced to meet the application's requirements effectively.</p>
