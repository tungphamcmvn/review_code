  <h1>Pull Request Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Pull Request Title</h2>
  <p>Implement API to Project Budget for System Admin / Builder role</p>
  <h2>2. Architecture Alignment</h2>
  <p>The changes in diff.txt align with the overall application architecture described in codebase.txt. No major
    discrepancies or adjustments needed.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The modifications fit within the existing directory structure and
    follow the separation of concerns principle, with changes made to the appropriate service, repository, and API
    route.</p>
  <h2>3. Best Practices Assessment</h2>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The changes adhere to common Next.js and React best practices. The code
    is modular, uses appropriate naming conventions, and follows a consistent style.</p>
  <p>Consider adding JSDoc comments to document the new API endpoint and any complex logic.</p>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
  <p>The changes do not introduce any apparent performance or security issues.</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">The new API endpoint follows the existing authentication and
    authorization mechanisms, ensuring only authorized users can access the project budget functionality.</p>
  <p>To optimize performance, consider adding caching mechanisms for frequently accessed budget data.</p>
  <h2>5. Code Logic Evaluation</h2>
  <p>The code logic for implementing the project budget API appears sound. The changes include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding a new route in the API to handle project budget requests.</li>
    <li>Implementing the corresponding service and repository methods to interact with the database.</li>
    <li>Incorporating necessary validations and error handling.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="background-color:red;color:white;">However, there seems to be missing error handling in the catch block of
    the API route. Make sure to handle and return appropriate error responses.</p>
  <h2>6. Estimation Time</h2>
  <p>Estimated development time for a senior developer: 2-4 hours</p>
  <p>This estimate includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Designing and implementing the new API endpoint.</li>
    <li>Writing the corresponding service and repository methods.</li>
    <li>Adding necessary validations and error handling.</li>
    <li>Writing tests to ensure the functionality works as expected.</li>
    <li>Updating any relevant documentation.</li>
  </ul>
