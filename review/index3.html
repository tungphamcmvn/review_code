  <h1>Git Commit Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Commit Message</h2>
  <p class="positive">The commit appears to implement bulk API endpoints for controlling user status
    (activate/deactivate) and deletion. This aligns well with the commit message "Apply api bulk control for change
    status, delete". The changes touch various layers of the application including the API routes, UI components,
    services, enums, and types.</p>
  <h2>2. Application Architecture Alignment</h2>
  <p class="positive">The changes fit into the intended application architecture:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>API routes are updated in <code>src/app/api</code></li>
    <li>UI components for user management are modified in <code>src/components/user</code></li>
    <li>Services and type definitions are adjusted accordingly</li>
    <li>Enums are leveraged to enforce consistent status values</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="positive">No major adjustments seem necessary from an architecture perspective. The separation of concerns
    between API, UI, services etc. is maintained.</p>
  <h2>3. Coding Best Practices</h2>
  <p class="positive">Several coding best practices are followed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>TypeScript is used for type safety</li>
    <li>API routes use Next.js conventions with folder and file based routing</li>
    <li>React components are organized into subfolders</li>
    <li>Enums enforce consistent values for user status</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="negative">A few potential improvements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider extracting inline styles in <code>ButtonSelectStatus</code> to a separate stylesheet for better
      separation of concerns</li>
    <li>Avoid force casting with <code>as</code> like <code>filter((i) =&gt; Boolean(i)) as string[];</code> in favor of
      type narrowing for better type safety</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
  <p class="positive">Implementing bulk endpoints is a good performance optimization to avoid making separate API calls
    to update/delete each user.</p>
  <p class="positive">Using enums for user status values avoids "magic strings" and helps enforce consistent, expected
    values which is good for security and data integrity.</p>
  <p class="negative">Ensure the bulk update/delete endpoints have proper authorization checks on the backend to prevent
    unauthorized mass updates or deletions of users.</p>
  <h2>5. Development Time Estimate</h2>
  <p>Considering this spans API routes, React components, services, and type definitions, a senior developer would
    likely need in the range of <strong>4-6 hours</strong> to develop, test and review these changes.</p>
