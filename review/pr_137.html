  <h1>Pull Request Analysis</h1>
  <h2>1. Pull Request Title</h2>
  <p>Based on the diff.txt file, an appropriate title for this pull request would be:</p>
  <p style="background-color:green;color:white;">Fix user listing pagination issue and add additional utility methods
  </p>
  <p>The pull request seems to address a bug where the user listing does not switch properly when changing pages
    (#J2C-369). It also appears to add some new utility methods, likely to the Date and Currency utility classes based
    on the branch name (J2C...).</p>
  <h2>2. Architecture Alignment</h2>
  <p>The changes in diff.txt align with the described application architecture:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="background-color:green;color:white;">The code changes are located in the src/utils directory, which
        matches the description of utility functions and helpers.</span></li>
    <li>No discrepancies with the application structure or db schema are apparent from the limited diff provided.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>3. Best Practices Assessment</h2>
  <p>Without more code context it's difficult to fully assess alignment with Next.js and React.js best practices.
    However, a few notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The code changes seem to be adding utility functions, which aligns with keeping the codebase modular and
      reusable.</li>
    <li>Ensure the new utility functions have clear names, are properly typed, and include JSDoc style documentation
      comments.</li>
    <li>If the functions interact with any external libraries, ensure proper error handling and consider security
      implications.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>4. Performance and Security</h2>
  <p>The code additions are utility functions, so performance and security impact is likely minimal. However, a couple
    considerations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For date/time utilities, ensure any third-party libraries are updated and have no known vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>For currency formatting, ensure the methods properly handle a variety of locales and currency codes to avoid
      unintended behavior.</li>
    <li>Consider adding unit tests for the new utility functions to verify proper behavior and prevent regressions.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>5. Code Logic Evaluation</h2>
  <p>Without the full function implementations it's difficult to evaluate the code logic. However:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the pagination fix properly handles edge cases like the last page, or when filters/sorting are applied.
    </li>
    <li>For the new utility functions, consider edge cases and ensure the logic aligns with expected behavior for dates
      and currencies (e.g. properly handles daylight savings, different currency formats, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>6. Estimation Time</h2>
  <p>For a senior developer, the estimated time to develop this pull request would likely be in the range of <span
      style="background-color:green;color:white;">2-4 hours</span>, assuming:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1-2 hours to investigate and fix the pagination bug</li>
    <li>1-2 hours to add the new, well-tested utility functions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The actual time required would depend on the complexity of the pagination issue and the exact specifications for
    the new utility functions.</p>
