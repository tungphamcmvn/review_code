1. README.md:
   - Provides guidelines for setting up and running the application in development and production environments using Docker Compose.
   - Specifies the required environment variables to be set in the .env file before starting the application.
   - Includes instructions for starting and stopping the application in both development and production modes.

2. next.config.js:
   - Next.js configuration file that includes various settings for the application.
   - Configures TypeScript with the option to ignore build errors.
   - Sets up ESLint to run on specific directories and ignore errors during production builds.
   - Configures Sass options with include paths for styles.
   - Enables modular imports for specific libraries like @mui/material, @mui/lab, and @mui/icons-material.
   - Sets up image optimization with remote patterns for a specific CDN domain.
   - Defines environment variables to be used throughout the application.

3. src/config.ts:
   - Defines application-wide configuration settings.
   - Specifies the layout type (vertical or horizontal) and drawer type (default or mini-drawer).
   - Sets the font family using the Roboto font from Google Fonts.
   - Configures the border radius, outlined filled style, navigation type (light or dark), preset color theme, locale, and other layout options.

4. src/middleware.ts:
   - Defines middleware functions for authentication and authorization checks.
   - Utilizes the 'stackMiddlewares' function to apply multiple middleware functions in a specific order.
   - Includes middleware functions such as 'withUnAuth', 'withAuth', and 'withJwt' for handling authentication and authorization.
   - Specifies the configuration for dynamic imports and allows specific third-party modules.

5. src/routes.ts:
   - Defines route configurations for various pages and components in the application.
   - Specifies the label, URL, and key for each route.
   - Includes routes for authentication pages (login, register, forgot password), user-related pages (profile, user management), error pages, and other application-specific pages.

6. src/auth.ts:
   - Configures NextAuth.js authentication options.
   - Sets up authentication providers, including credentials and Google OAuth.
   - Defines session management options, such as strategy and maxAge.
   - Configures JWT options for token generation and expiration.
   - Implements callbacks for handling authentication flow, including 'jwt' and 'session' callbacks.
   - Specifies the custom sign-in page URL.

7. Additional Directories and Files:

Your analysis should result in an HTML document titled "Pull Request Analysis" with six distinct sections that:

1. *Pull Request Title:* Examine 'diff.txt' to provide a detailed summary of the pull request's purpose. Craft a clear and comprehensive pull request title reflecting the modifications.
2. *Architecture Alignment:* Compare the 'diff.txt' modifications with the described application architecture and db schema('dbschema.txt'). Identify any discrepancies and suggest necessary adjustments for alignment.
3. *Best Practices Assessment:* Evaluate the changes in 'diff.txt' against Next.js, React.js coding standards. Recommend corrections and improvements for adherence to best practices.
4. *Performance and Security:* Analyze modifications for performance and security impacts within the Next.js, React.js, and MongoDB context. Offer enhancement suggestions for optimization.
5. *Code Logic Evaluation:* Discuss the code logic based on the changes, highlighting issues and improvements.
6. *Estimation Time:* The time in range that a senior developer would need to develop that pull request.

Additionally, provide an estimation of the development time required by a senior developer for these pull requests.

Structure your document with HTML tags, ensuring:

- Issues are highlighted with a `style="background-color:red;color:white;"`. 
- Positive feedback is marked with a `style="background-color:green;color:white;"`.
- Include actionable feedback, structured information, and code snippets or examples where applicable.

Ensure the analysis is detailed, actionable, and presented in a structured format to aid in understanding and applying the recommendations.
