  src: Main source code, including:
  app: Web page route handlers for server-side rendering.
  dashboard: Dashboard interface components.
  minimal: Screens for authentication and user verification.
  api: Backend API endpoints categorized by model or functionality.
  [...nextauth]: Authentication route handlers.
  backend: Database connection and API logic.
  middleware: Authentication and authorization checks.
  model: MongoDB schema definitions.
  repositories: Database interaction methods.
  services: API controllers.
  storage: S3 configuration for file storage.
  observer: Notification configuration.
  structs: Common API response formats.
  validator: Input validation classes and rules.
  constant: Application-wide constants.
  contexts: Session context management.
  hook: Client-side logic.

  Your task is to:

    1. Examine the 'git-diff.txt' file and summarize the purpose of the changes made in the commit. Provide a clear and comprehensive commit message that accurately reflects the modifications.
    2. Compare the changes in the 'git-diff.txt' file against the application's structural and functional description provided above. Suggest any necessary adjustments to ensure the changes align with the intended application architecture.
    3. Assess the modifications in the 'git-diff.txt' file against Next.js, React.js, and MongoDB coding best practices. Propose corrections and improvements to adhere to these best practices.
    4. Evaluate the changes for performance and security considerations in the context of Next.js, React.js, and MongoDB. Recommend enhancements to optimize for both performance and security.
    5. Estimate the time range (in hours) a senior developer would need to develop that commit.
