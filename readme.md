Your task is to:

1. Examine the 'git-diff.txt' file and summarize the purpose of the changes made in the commit. Provide a clear and comprehensive commit message that accurately reflects the modifications.
2. Compare the changes in the 'git-diff.txt' file against the application's structural and functional description provided above. Suggest any necessary adjustments to ensure the changes align with the intended application architecture.
3. Assess the modifications in the 'git-diff.txt' file against Next.js, React.js, and MongoDB coding best practices. Propose corrections and improvements to adhere to these best practices.
4. Evaluate the changes for performance and security considerations in the context of Next.js, React.js, and MongoDB. Recommend enhancements to optimize for both performance and security.
5. Estimate the time range (in hours) a senior developer would need to develop that commit.


Please create an HTML document that includes a title "Git Commit Analysis" and five distinct sections corresponding to the tasks outlined. Each section should clearly identify an issue encountered, followed by a recommendation for improvement. The document should be structured with HTML tags, ensuring that negative feedback is highlighted with a red background and positive feedback with a green background and white text.

Please ensure the analysis is detailed and actionable, and provide your feedback in a structured format, including code snippets or examples where applicable.
